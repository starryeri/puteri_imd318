<h3>MY FAVOURITE FOOD & DRINKS</h3>
 <img src="images/matcha.jpg" alt="matcha drink and tiramisu cake" style="height: 350px; width: 250px; margin: 10px;"> <img src="images/matcha1.jpg" alt="matcha drinks" style="height: 350px; width: 250px; margin: 10px;"> <img src="images/matcha4.jpg" alt="matcha drinks" style="height: 350px; width: 250px; margin: 10px;">


<p>As you can see the pictures above, I am very into <b>matcha and tiramisu cakes</b> as of lately! I would say they are my favourite food and drinks because the taste are so amazing together. <img src="animation/pusheen.gif" alt="pusheen cat" style="height: 250px; width: 250px; margin: 10px; float: right;">I love eating <b>tiramisu cakes</b> when they melt in my mouth. I also love <b>matcha drinks</b> as they have different tastes than most drinks nowadays :-)  <img src="animation/pusheen1.gif" alt="pusheen cat" style="height: 250px; width: 250px; margin: 10px; float: left;"></p>

<p><i>Pistachio Matcha Kunafa</i> that I ordered in <b>Coffee Bean!</b> It was so delicious!! I went there with my aunt and it was the last piece of cake that they had! Luckily We just got there in time.</p>

<p>Last month, I went on a family trip to the <b>Fraser's Hill in Pahang.</b> It was such a nice and cold weather but the journey to the top was so nauseous and dizzy for me when I was sitting inside the car! Overall, It was such a great experience for me and my family because we have always wanted to visit this place! </p>
