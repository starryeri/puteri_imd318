<h1>MY BELOVED FATHER AND MOTHER</h1>
<p>My father, <b>Ishak bin Maarip</b> was born at Masjid Tanah, Malacca and he was born on September 1977 while my mother, <b>Raja Nazeli binti Raja Iskandar Shah</b> was born at Muar, Johor and she was also born on January 1977. They met each other at UiTM Lendu, Melaka while doing their diploma. They were married on 2004 and thus, a year later, I was born! ^_^</p>

<h1>MY SIBLINGS</h1>
<p>I have two siblings and I am the eldest out of the two. My first little brother, <b>Raja Rayyan Iman bin Ishak</b>was born on November 2006. He is now studying Estate Management at UiTM Seri Iskandar Perak. My second little brother, <b>Raja Izzat Iman bin Ishak</b> was born on May 2008 and he just finished his SPM and now our family is waiting for the result. I love playing and spending time with my siblings even though they would love to disturb and bother me most of the time.</p>
